This project will help you to run TeamCity 2020.2.1 on your Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. Might work for older versions of Raspberry Pi.

Before starting, install docker-compose.

Open http://<host>:8111 to access Teamcity. There are some remaining steps
that you need to do in the web UI, especially authorizing the build agent.
